Description: This package provides tools for simulating and analyzing romantic dynamics 
  between two individuals using two-dimensional autonomous differential equations 
  and simple game-theoretic models. It applies the Euler method for numerical integration 
  and includes utilities for modeling decision-making scenarios such as confession strategies. 
  Developed as part of the author's exploration into R's object-oriented programming 
  and package development systems.
