\title{Solve for the confession probability that equalizes expected payoffs under two opposing responses}
\usage{
ev_solve(Score)
}
\arguments{
\item{Score}{A 2Ã—2 numeric matrix.
See \code{\link{lvrCreate}} for the detailed construction and meaning of each element in the matrix.}
}
\value{
A named vector with optimal confession probability `p` and the corresponding expected effect.

\description{
Solve for the confession probability that equalizes expected payoffs under two opposing responses
}
\details{
This function constructs and solves a linear equation to identify the confession probability \code{p}
at which the individual receives the same expected effect whether the other person always accepts
or always rejects the confession.

Specifically, it sets up the equation:

\deqn{
p \cdot s_{11} + (1 - p) \cdot s_{12} = p \cdot s_{21} + (1 - p) \cdot s_{22}
}

Here:
\itemize{
  \item \eqn{s_{11}} is the effect when one confesses and the other accepts.
  \item \eqn{s_{12}} is the effect when one does not confess but the other would have accepted.
  \item \eqn{s_{21}} is the effect when one confesses but the other rejects.
  \item \eqn{s_{22}} is the effect when one does not confess and the other would have rejected.
}

Solving this equation yields the probability \eqn{p} at which the two opposing strategies yield
equal expected outcomes, providing a rational, balanced decision point when the other's response
is uncertain.
