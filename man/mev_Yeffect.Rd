\title{Calculate the Mean Expected Effect on an Individual Based on the Other Person's Response}
\usage{
mev_Yeffect(X = NULL, pX = NULL, pY, Score = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{An object of class \code{lvr}, representing the individual making the confession.}

\item{pX}{Numeric. The probability that the individual chooses to confess.}

\item{pY}{Numeric. The probability that the other person accepts the confession.}

\item{Score}{A 2Ã—2 numeric matrix. Represents the effect matrix of individual choices and responses after a confession.}
}
\value{
A numeric value indicating the overall expected effect on the individual, integrating both the acceptance and rejection outcomes.
}
\description{
Calculate the Mean Expected Effect on an Individual Based on the Other Person's Response
}
\details{
This function evaluates the expected average effect on an individual by weighting both possible outcomes:
the other person accepts or rejects the confession.

The interpretation of the \code{score} matrix is consistent with the definitions in \code{\link{lvrCreate}} and \code{\link{ev_Yeffect}}.
Specifically, the effect matrix is:

\deqn{
\begin{bmatrix}
s_{11} & s_{12} \\
s_{21} & s_{22}
\end{bmatrix}
}

See \code{\link{lvrCreate}} for the detailed construction and meaning of each element in the matrix.

\examples{
score <- matrix(c(3, 1, -1, 0), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)

               Lvsef = function(x, y) x, Lvoth = function(x, y) y,
               Score = score)
